# Practical Lab 2: Multivariate Linear Regression, Non-Parametric Models and Cross-Validation

**Dataset:** Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset

**Objective:** Build models to predict the disease progression one year after baseline. Models include univariate polynomial regressions (BMI), multivariate polynomial models, Decision Trees, kNNs, and Logistic Regression classifiers (as a screening classifier). Evaluate using RÂ², MAE, and MAPE; use a train/validation/test split.
